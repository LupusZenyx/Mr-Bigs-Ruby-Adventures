# Mr. Big's Ruby Misadventures 🔥

## Introduction
Welcome to the realm of Mr. Big's Ruby Misadventures, where we journey into the enigmatic world of Ruby code, guided by the one and only Mr. Big. Prepare yourself for a coding experience like no other, where the teacher is as exotic as the code itself. 🦖

## The Fear of Fire 🔥
In Mr. Big's kingdom, even the discovery of fire is a recent revelation, and he's still trembling at the thought of it. So, as you dive into the world of Ruby, remember to keep things as un-fiery as possible. We wouldn't want to alarm him!

## Ruby: The Exotic Enigma 🌟
Ruby, the language of intrigue, is as exotic to Mr. Big as a UFO sighting. He might not fully grasp it, but that's part of the adventure! Expect code that dances to its own tune and a teacher who's just as bewildered as you.

## Mr. Big's Code Commandments 📜
- **Avoid Fire:** Keep your code fire-free. Mr. Big is still recovering from the shock.
- **Stick to the Basics:** Don't venture into the wild depths of Ruby; it's a path unknown to our teacher.
- **Don't Confuse Him:** Copy-pasting is your friend. Mr. Big thrives on predictability.

## How to Contribute (If You Dare) 🤝
